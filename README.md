# Plasma Toroid

This project is a modification of the amazing project that is currently being hosted here
https://hackaday.io/project/194683-plasma-toroid-sky-guided-pcb-edition

# Notable Changes
- Added USB-PD built in
- Removed the arc lighter, since the parts are hard to find and expensive
  - Will probably revisit this in the future
- Trying out two MOSFETs to see heat dissipation, will update the design once I've determined a winner
